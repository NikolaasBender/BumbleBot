# BumbleBot
This is the work for bumblebot 

BumbleBot is like a roomba but more pointless. 
I am making this to  teach myself python, vision systems, motor control, and over the air updates. 
==========
PHASE 1
==========
This is the dumb dumb mode. The robot moves around and bumbs into stuff which clicks a physical button and gets
the robot to choose a new direction of travel. The cameras will be active to collect data for future iterations of the
software where vision systems will be useful.
===========
PHASE 2
===========
The software will be updated over the air. A simple vision system will be implimented. It will be using open cv to get
the robot to chase colors. Continuing to collect vidoe data for future iterations.
===========
PHASE 3
===========
A neural net will be created to make the robot drive about without bumbing into stuff. Getting it to complete specific weird tasks like moving trash cans or closing open doors.

This may seem kind of pointless but all of what will be learned through this process can be applied to other projects involving vision systems, sensing enviornemnt, ai, and motor control.
